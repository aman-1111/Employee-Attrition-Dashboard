## 🧠 Overview

Employee attrition refers to employees leaving an organisation (voluntarily or involuntarily). The goal of this dashboard is to visualise and analyse attrition with respect to various HR metrics — such as performance, departments, or other available attributes — so stakeholders can identify trends and take action to improve retention.

This project includes data visuals and analysis stored primarily in an Excel workbook, supported by screenshots showing the dashboard view.
